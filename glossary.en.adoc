[glossary]
== Glossary

[[activity]]activity:: Movement in front of a <<camera>>. Movement can cause a <<trigger>> when certain conditions are met (e.g. within the <<detection-zone,detection zone>> and outside the <<quiet-period,quiet period>>). Camera traps are typically <<deployment,deployed>> to capture wildlife activity, but may also record movements of humans, vehicles or vegetation.

[[alignment]]alignment:: Physical placement of a <<camera>>. Consists of <<camera-height,camera height>>, <<camera-tilt,camera tilt>> and <<camera-heading,camera heading>>.

[[AI]]artificial intelligence:: Ability to perceive, synthesize and infer information as demonstrated by machines, as opposed to humans/animals. In camera trap research, AI is mainly applied as <<machine-learning,machine learning>> to perform <<computer-vision,computer vision>> tasks. See also <<section-artificial-intelligence>>.

[[bait]]bait:: Attractant used to encourage animals to investigate a <<location>> or specific point within the <<detection-zone,detection zone>>. Baits may be auditory, olfactory, visual, or some combination of these in nature. Whether bait was used for a <<deployment>> is useful to know for analyses, as it can alter the natural behaviour of animals. Can be expressed as a categorical description (e.g. `acoustic`, `visual`, `scent`) or a boolean. Also referred to as `lure` cite:[meek-2014]. {deployments-baitUse} in Camtrap DP.

[[blank]]blank:: <<media,Media>> without objects of interest. Blanks are typically the result of false <<trigger,triggers>> such as moving vegetation or fluctuating light. Marked as such when <<classification,classifying>> to facilitate excluding them from queries.

[[camera]]camera:: Device designed to automatically capture <<media>> of (wildlife) <<activity>>, typically <<trigger,triggered>> by a combination of heat and motion. Of a certain make and model and uniquely identifiable by e.g. by serial number. Also referred to as `camera trap`, `game camera`, `trail camera`, `scouting camera` or `device`.

[[camera-height]]camera height:: Height of the camera above the ground, a component of camera <<alignment>>. Can be expressed in meters above the ground or as a categorical description (`knee height` ~ 0.5m, `chest height` ~ 1.5m,  `canopy` ~ 3+m in citenp:[wildlife-insights]). {deployments-cameraHeight} in Camtrap DP.

[[camera-tilt]]camera tilt:: Up or down orientation of the camera, a component of camera <<alignment>>. Can be expressed in degrees or as a categorical description (`parallel` = 0°, `pointed downward` = -90° in citenp:[wildlife-insights]). {deployments-cameraTilt} in Camtrap DP.

[[camera-heading]]camera heading:: Horizontal cardinal orientation of the camera, a component of camera <<alignment>>. Can be expressed in degrees from North or as cardinal directions (N, NW, etc.). {deployments-cameraHeading} in Camtrap DP.

[[camtrap-dp]]Camtrap DP:: Camera Trap Data Package. A community developed <<data-exchange-format,data exchange format>> for camera trap data, maintained under Biodiversity Information Standards (https://www.tdwg.org[TDWG]). See also <<section-camtrap-dp>>, citenp:[bubnicki-2023] and the https://camtrap-dp.tdwg.org[Camtrap DP website].

[[classification]]classification:: The act of classifying camera trap <<media>>, resulting in <<observation,observations>>. Not to be confused with taxonomic classification. Can be performed in different steps and with different levels of precision, e.g. 1. media does/does not contain object(s) of interest (i.e. <<blank>>), 2. object of interest is human/vehicle/animal or unknown, 3. animal is member of certain taxon (e.g. Sus scrofa, Rodentia), 4. animal is of certain sex/life stage, is known <<individual>> x or shows certain behaviour. Classification is typically labour intensive and therefore often aided by <<computer-vision,computer vision>>, <<citizen-science,volunteers>> and/or classifying <<sequence,sequences>> rather than individual <<media-file,media files>>. Also referred to as `image classification`, `annotation` or `identification`. See also <<section-classification>>.

[[citizen-science]]citizen science:: Scientific research conducted with participation from the public. Also referred to as `community science`, `crowd science`, `crowdsourcing`, or `volunteer monitoring`. In camera trap research, citizen scientists can participate in camera trap <<deployment>> and <<classification>>. See also <<section-citizen-science>>.

[[computer-vision]]computer vision:: Processing, analysing and understanding of <<media>> by machines to aid <<classification>>, from object tracking to species identification. A form of artificial intelligence, typically trained with <<machine-learning,machine learning>>.

[[covariates]]covariates:: Ecological variables that may affect the behaviour and detection of animals (e.g. <<bait,bait use>>, <<feature-type,feature type>>, <<habitat-type,habitat>>, canopy cover). Recording covariates is important for further analysis of the data. See also <<section-covariates>>.

[[data-exchange-format]]data exchange format:: Format used to exchange data between systems (e.g. <<camtrap-dp,Camtrap DP>> and <<darwin-core-archive,Darwin Core Archive>>). Requires data transformation from the source system to the format and from the format to the target system. Well designed data exchange formats facilitate <<FAIR>> data exchange, use open formats and provide clear definitions. Also referred to as `data standard` (when approved through a ratification process).

[[data-management-system]]data management system:: Online or desktop application to manage camera trap data.
