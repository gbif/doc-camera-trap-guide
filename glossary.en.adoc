== Glossary

[[activity]]activity:: Movement in front of a <<camera>>. Movement can cause a <<trigger>> when certain conditions are met (e.g. within the <<detection-zone,detection zone>> and outside the <<quiet-period,quiet period>>). Camera traps are typically <<deployment,deployed>> to capture wildlife activity, but may also record movements of humans, vehicles or vegetation.

[[alignment]]alignment:: Physical placement of a <<camera>>. Consists of <<camera-height,camera height>>, <<camera-tilt,camera tilt>> and <<camera-heading,camera heading>>.

[[AI]]artificial intelligence:: Ability to perceive, synthesize and infer information as demonstrated by machines, as opposed to humans/animals. In camera trap research, AI is mainly applied as <<machine-learning,machine learning>> to perform <<computer-vision,computer vision>> tasks.

[[bait]]bait:: Attractant used to encourage animals to investigate a <<location>> or specific point within the <<detection-zone,detection zone>>. Baits may be auditory, olfactory, visual, or some combination of these in nature. Whether bait was used for a <<deployment>> is useful to know for analyses, as it can alter the natural behaviour of animals. Can be expressed as a categorical description (e.g. `acoustic`, `visual`, `scent`) or a boolean. Also referred to as `lure` (<<ref_meek_2014>>). term:camtrapdp[deployments.baitUse] in Camtrap DP.

[[blank]]blank:: TODO

[[camera]]camera:: Device designed to automatically capture <<media>> of (wildlife) <<activity>>, typically <<trigger,triggered>> by a combination of heat and motion. Of a certain make and model and uniquely identifiable by e.g. by serial number. Also referred to as `camera trap`, `game camera`, `trail camera`, `scouting camera` or `device`.

[[camera-height]]camera height:: Height of the camera above the ground, a component of camera <<alignment>>. Can be expressed in meters above the ground or as a categorical description (`knee height` ~ 0.5m, `chest height` ~ 1.5m,  `canopy` ~ 3+m, <<ref_wildlife_insights>>). {deployments_cameraHeight} in Camtrap DP.

[[camera-tilt]]camera tilt:: Up or down orientation of the camera, a component of camera <<alignment>>. Can be expressed in degrees or as a categorical description (`parallel` = 0°, `pointed downward` = -90°, <<ref_wildlife_insights>>). term:camtrapdp[deployments.cameraTilt] in Camtrap DP.

[[camera-heading]]camera heading:: Horizontal cardinal orientation of the camera, a component of camera <<alignment>>. Can be expressed in degrees from North or as cardinal directions (N, NW, etc.). term:camtrapdp[deployments.cameraHeading] in Camtrap DP.

[[classification]]classification:: The act of classifying camera trap <<media>>, resulting in <<observation,observations>>. Not to be confused with taxonomic classification. Can be performed in different steps and with different levels of precision, e.g. 1. media does/does not contain object(s) of interest (i.e. `blank`), 2. object of interest is human/vehicle/animal or unknown, 3. animal is member of certain taxon (e.g. Sus scrofa, Rodentia), 4. animal is of certain sex/life stage, is known individual x or shows certain behaviour. Classification is typically labour intensive and therefore often aided by <<computer-vision,computer vision>>, <<citizen-science,volunteers>> and/or classifying <<sequence,sequences>> rather than individual <<media-file,media files>>. Also referred to as `image classification`, `annotation` or `identification`.

[[citizen-science]]citizen science:: Scientific research conducted with participation from the public.
