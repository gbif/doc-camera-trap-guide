[glossary]
== Glossary

[[activity]]activity:: Movement in front of a <<camera>>. Movement can cause a <<trigger>> when certain conditions are met (e.g. within the <<detection-zone,detection zone>> and outside the <<quiet-period,quiet period>>). Camera traps are typically <<deployment,deployed>> to capture wildlife activity, but may also record movements of humans, vehicles or vegetation.

[[alignment]]alignment:: Physical placement of a <<camera>>. Consists of <<camera-height,camera height>>, <<camera-tilt,camera tilt>> and <<camera-heading,camera heading>>.

[[AI]]artificial intelligence:: Ability to perceive, synthesize and infer information as demonstrated by machines, as opposed to humans/animals. In camera trap research, AI is mainly applied as <<machine-learning,machine learning>> to perform <<computer-vision,computer vision>> tasks. See also <<section-artificial-intelligence>>.

[[bait]]bait:: Attractant used to encourage animals to investigate a <<location>> or specific point within the <<detection-zone,detection zone>>. Baits may be auditory, olfactory, visual, or some combination of these in nature. Whether bait was used for a <<deployment>> is useful to know for analyses, as it can alter the natural behaviour of animals. Can be expressed as a categorical description (e.g. `acoustic`, `visual`, `scent`) or a boolean. Also referred to as `lure` cite:[meek-2014]. {deployments-baitUse} in Camtrap DP.

[[blank]]blank:: Empty image, containing no animals. Empty images often result from false triggers by non-animal events, such as vegetation swinging or fluctuation of light.

[[camera]]camera:: Device designed to automatically capture <<media>> of (wildlife) <<activity>>, typically <<trigger,triggered>> by a combination of heat and motion. Of a certain make and model and uniquely identifiable by e.g. by serial number. Also referred to as `camera trap`, `game camera`, `trail camera`, `scouting camera` or `device`.

[[camera-height]]camera height:: Height of the camera above the ground, a component of camera <<alignment>>. Can be expressed in meters above the ground or as a categorical description (`knee height` ~ 0.5m, `chest height` ~ 1.5m,  `canopy` ~ 3+m in citenp:[wildlife-insights]). {deployments-cameraHeight} in Camtrap DP.

[[camera-tilt]]camera tilt:: Up or down orientation of the camera, a component of camera <<alignment>>. Can be expressed in degrees or as a categorical description (`parallel` = 0°, `pointed downward` = -90° in citenp:[wildlife-insights]). {deployments-cameraTilt} in Camtrap DP.

[[camera-heading]]camera heading:: Horizontal cardinal orientation of the camera, a component of camera <<alignment>>. Can be expressed in degrees from North or as cardinal directions (N, NW, etc.). {deployments-cameraHeading} in Camtrap DP.

[[camtrap-dp]]Camtrap DP:: Camera Trap Data Package. A community developed <<data-exchange-format,data exchange format>> for camera trap data, managed by the Biodiviersity Information Standards (TDWG). See also <<section-camtrap-dp>> and the (https://tdwg.github.io/camtrap-dp/[Camtrap DP documentation website]).

[[classification]]classification:: The act of classifying camera trap <<media>>, resulting in <<observation,observations>>. Not to be confused with taxonomic classification. Can be performed in different steps and with different levels of precision, e.g. 1. media does/does not contain object(s) of interest (i.e. <<blank>>), 2. object of interest is human/vehicle/animal or unknown, 3. animal is member of certain taxon (e.g. Sus scrofa, Rodentia), 4. animal is of certain sex/life stage, is known individual x or shows certain behaviour. Classification is typically labour intensive and therefore often aided by <<computer-vision,computer vision>>, <<citizen-science,volunteers>> and/or classifying <<sequence,sequences>> rather than individual <<media-file,media files>>. Also referred to as `image classification`, `annotation` or `identification`. See also <<section-classification>>.

[[citizen-science]]citizen science:: Scientific research conducted with participation from the public. Also referred to as `community science`, `crowd science`, `crowdsourcing`, or `volunteer monitoring`.

[[computer-vision]]computer vision:: Processing, analyzing and understanding of <<media>> by machines to aid <<classification>>, from object tracking to species identification. A form of artificial intelligence, typically trained with <<machine-learning,machine learning>>.

[[covariates]]covariates:: Ecological variables that may affect the behaviour and thus detection of animals. Recording covariates is important for further analysis of the data. Examples are: bait use, feature type, habitat, canopy cover. See also <<section-covariates>>.

[[data-exchange-format]]data exchange format:: An interim data format desinged to exchange data from one data source to another. The source data is converted into the data exchange format by one program, and the data in the exchange format is converted to the target format by another. <<camtrap-dp,Camtrap DP>> is a data exchange format for camera trap data.

[[data-management-system]]data management system:: Online or desktop application to manage camera trap data. Typically includes functionality to upload <<media>>, add <<deployment>> information, <<classification,classify>> images, export data, invite <<participant,participants>> and manage a <<project>>. See also <<section-data-management-systems>>.
